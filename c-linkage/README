./c-linkage DIST_MATRIX NAMES_FILE OPTIONS

where OPTIONS is one of following:

  every NUMBER upto FRACTION

or

  only FRACTION

These two are best described by example:

./c-linkage DIST_MATRIX NAMES_FILE only 0.03

This will create a single clustering at 3 percent distance.

./c-linkage DIST_MATRIX NAMES_FILE every 10 upto 0.03

It will create clusterings at steps of 10 OTUs, until the 3 percent
distance is reached.

                      OUTPUT

cluster.list   - list of all OTUs in mothur format
cluster.rabund - rank abundance
