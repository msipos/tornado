              NOTES

Splicer only works with sequences in FASTA format.

              HOW TO INSTALL SPLICER

Splicer is self-contained. You must have Python installed to run it though.

Once you have Splicer downloaded, make it executable via
  
  chmod +x path_to_splicer/splicer

For example, if splicer is in your current directory, then you can just
use
  
  chmod +x ./splicer

To test, try out splicer on the example alignment file provided. Run

  ./splicer count example.fa

and you should see the output:
 
  Counted 36 sequences.

              HOW TO GET HELP IN SPLICER

Type

  splicer

to get a list of available commands. For each command you can run

  splicer help command

to get additional help on that command.

              HOW TO USE SPLICER TO PERFORM HAND CURATION

This short writeup explains how to use splicer to perform computer-assisted
hand curation. We will demonstrate this process on an example multiple
alignment that is provided with Splicer.

We are interested in hand-curating short hypervariable regions
in 16S sequences. The trick to do that is to first cut out the piece of our
multiple alignment that contains the hypervariable region.  In the example
file the hypervariable region lies between columns 202 and 236 (inclusive).
So we cut them out using:

  splicer cut example.fa 202-236 > cut.fa

Now we can dereplicate these cut sequences.

  splicer dereplicate cut.fa
  
Now cut.fa.derepl contains 14 sequences (from the initial 36). Now, we can align
these sequences manually using an alignment program such as Jalview.

Once these sequences are aligned, we can merge them back into the original
alignment

./splicer merge cut.fa.derepl into example.fa 202-236 > merged.fa

Now, look at merged.fa.  You will notice that our changes got merged back into
all 36 sequences of the large alignment, even though we only had to align 14.
