This tool calculates the Calinski-Harabasz index for the given clustering.

Build the tool via

  ./build.sh

You will need GCC and Glib 2 to build the tool.  Any standard Linux distribution should have these.  You may need "development" packages, for example, under Ubuntu you need to install the libglib2.0-dev package.

Run the tool via

  ./cluster-quality  FASTA_FILE  CLUSTERING_FILE

Here, the clustering file must be in the following format:
  - Each cluster is on a separate line. 
  - Names of the elements of the cluster are separated by commas.
For instance, a possible clustering of 3 elements (called E1, E2 and E3):

E1,E2
E3

In the clustering above, there are 2 clusters, one is E1+E2 and the other is just E3.

Another possible clustering of 5 elements:
E1
E2
E3,E4,E5

Above, there are 3 clusters, two singletons and one with three elements, E3, E4 and E5.

The names of elements (i.e. sequences), E1 through E5 above, have to correspond to those in the FASTA file. For instance:

>E1
ACGTACGT..
>E2
ACGTACCT..
